TODO:
- Add GUI with instructions
- Fully automate training (plat and no plat)
- Fix rarity checking other than common
- Fix script breaking when enemy uses ACC down (this is because it is checking the color white when the crit is ready to train, but the ACC down text is also white and overlaps the position where it is checking which causes the script to end prematurely. UPDATE: Maybe it's fixed, need more testing)

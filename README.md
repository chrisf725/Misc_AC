Auto trainer for Miscrits
-
This will automatically run the processes of battling and training crits. The processes will stop when a rare or above crit is encountered (unless specified in prompt for rare crits).

Requirements
- 1168 x 687 window size (min size)
- UI scaling max in game

How to use
- Before running the script, it is best to run a battle once so that the character stays in one place
- After running the script, you will be prompted if you want to platinum train, and if you want to ignore rare crits. You can type (yes/y/no/n) to these prompts
- Right click on the same object that was used for the battle to set it as the target for farming
- Finally, the script will battle and train crits

Things to note:
- You can press (P) to pause the script and (Q) to stop the script



TODO:
- Add interactable GUI (maybe)
